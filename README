============================
 nipy example doc structure
============================

This is a tiny repo to show an example of a nipy community project doc
structure.  It should compile (``cd doc && make html``).  To see what
you might want to change for your own project, try ``grep -r PROJECTNAME
*``

It's likely you'll also want to change the ``PROJECTNAME.css`` file to
make your project a bit more distinct.
